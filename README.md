#  Udacity VRPuzzler Project

This project is done as part of the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree program.

For this project we are required to design a simple mobile game/app, having the user experience in mind. To achieve this goal, we will conduct user testing to get feedback frequently, so that changes are easier to make in early stages of development. It is important to note that we take ergonomics, aural and visual stimuli into account to implement an intuitive and easy to play game.

The goal of this project was to teach me the fundamentals in design and user centered thinking in VR and motion in VR.

In this the player will click start button and will enter dungeon and must solve the puzzle in order to exit the room.This VR project will be used by the Puzzle Solver or VR Geeks to have better experience of VR to solve a puzzle.

## Unique Consideration

During completion of the project, I learn many design consideration , such as immersive sound effect, belivable lighting , comfortable player motion, proper scale etc.


## Puzzler
This project was successful thanks to iterative approach that was used to consistently improve the game. The goal was to make user feel comfortable inside the VR scene and to make the game as intuitive as possible.

## Process of the Development
Statement of Purpose: Puzzler is a mobile VR application for new VR users which challenges them to solve a familiar type of puzzle in a new way.

## Sketches
This are the sketches made at starting of the design Process in Vr.

## User Testing
#### User Test 1 :-> Aakash, Student 20
1. What would you say is the mood of the place that you are in?

    It is very darker somewhere feels more horrible.

2. How big you think you are in this experience?

    I think I am little bit smaller then I am, other object are far bigger.

3. Is there anything that you’d like to look at but difficult to see?
  
    Yes the giant dinosaur over my head is not visible to me and there are very few light source makes difficult to see.

4. Is our experience comfortable?

    Overall experience is not that good due to less lighting and scale

#### User Test 2 :-> Ritik, Engineer 28

1. What would you say is the mood of the place that you are in?

    The mood is very horrible as per the scene due to dinosaurs

2. How big you think you are in this experience?

    I think like I am like a kid here.

3. Is there anything that you’d like to look at but difficult to see?

    Yes lighting makes scene little bit difficult to see.

4. Is our experience comfortable?

    Yes quiet comfortable experience but can be more improved by lighting

#### User Test 3 :-> UI Feedback

1. How Big would you say that panel is ?

    Is quite good and easy to see .

2. What do you think this panel is for?

    This panel is for the start of the game name Puzzler.

3. What do you think happens if you hit that button?

    It will Start my game puzzle take me to game scene.

4. Can you tell me what will be the next screen that you see is for?

    next screen is the restart of the game or to quit the game.

#### User Test 4: Movement Feedback
1. Did you zoom into Room?

     yes i did, quite good mood scene

2. How did you feel about the speed of that movement?

    it has comfortable pace.

3. Are you feeling sick or something?
    No, Its Very Handy.
    
## Iteration

Analyzing the feedback received, I decided to create user/player Little bit larger than it was so that he will feel same size in the scene and added more light to scene so that it will not look Horrible and iterated the same process till user feel comfortble

## Break down of the final piece
    
    Here I have the following VR application.
    Player starts from the main menu, that is located outside the dungeon.

    While player is standing outside, he is standing in a open environment.
    When user clicks Start button, he moves to the dungeon, where the game takes place.

    Orbs, that are located in the room, lights up in a random sequence. 
    User has to remember the sequence and to click on orbs in the same order.

## Conclusion

    This app was built to learn the fundamentals of design in virtual reality. 
    During my work on this app I used such design techniques as making sketches of future app implementation, using personas to make         decisions, iterating through the development process using real people feedbacks and others. As a result, Puzzler appears to be         simple, but rather comfortable and immersive VR experience.
